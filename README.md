# ZIP Domains - A Comprehensive Data Catalogue

ZIP Domains is a project that provides up-to-date information on newly registered .zip domains. In the wake of Google introducing the .zip TLD, concerns over potential security threats have emerged. This project addresses these concerns by collecting, analysing, and publishing data related to the .zip domains.

## Objective

Our aim is to provide a reliable, regularly updated data set of newly registered .zip domains. The objective is to equip the community with insights and understanding of potential risks tied to these domains. The goal is to promote online security and aid in the mitigation of threats tied to the .zip TLD.

## Disclaimer

Despite striving to provide accurate and timely data, our project should be considered a supplementary resource. It should not be used as the sole determiner of a .zip domain's security status. Users are urged to exercise judgement and employ additional security measures.
